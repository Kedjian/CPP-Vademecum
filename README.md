basics-or-not on c++

Thank you for having checked in! This will be my personal vademecum, a place where I'll be keeping track of my journey, the highs and lows of C++ learning. 
If you're an advanced or even intermediate programmer, you won't find much of interest here. 

I started programming with an attitude to improve around 21/05/2023. My very first programme was a simple calculator made up of ifs, cins and couts. 
It felt pretty good at the time to create it without any switches or functions. 

Unfortunately it is no longer on display here.
