# CPP-Vademecum
Basics-or-not on C++.

Thank you for having checked in! This will be my personal vademecum, a place where I'll be keeping track of my journey, the highs and lows of C++ learning. 
If you're an advanced or even intermediate programmer, you won't find much of interest here. 

I started programming with an attitude to improve around 21/05/2023.
