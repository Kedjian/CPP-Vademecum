# CPP-Vademecum
Basics-or-not on C++.

Thank you for having checked in! This will be my personal vademecum, a place where I'll be keeping track of my journey, the highs and lows of C++ learning. 
If you're an advanced or even intermediate programmer, you won't find much of interest here. 

I started programming with an attitude to improve around 21/05/2023.

Until 13/06/2023 I was using the website programiz.com, but I decided to switch to learncpp. I was told that progamizm.com was far too laconic by my other half - a full-time employed programmer.
Naturally, I took his instructions to heart and decided to change at once. It's too bad I've already written some "programs" before, because it's going to be messy out here. Anyway, no need to be perfectionist.
